Divmmc with allram

Added new control port ZXMMC_ENABLE, address $F3/243 with the following function:

D7 -> ALLRAM, D6 -> WRLOCK, D5 -> MAPDISABLE, D4-D0 reserved for future use

ALLRAM=1 disables spectrum rom and maps divmmc ram into $0000-$4000 memory space, there are 8 ram pages on 128K divmmc and 32 pages with 512K.
WRLOCK=1 locks any write to divmmc ram 
MAPDISABLE=1 prevents any automatic rom mapping from the interface. SD card interface is always enabled.
All bits are cleared on poweron, reset does nothing

Pages addressing:

Ram pages are selected with spectrum 128 paging registers (port 7ffdh bit 4 and port 1ffdh bit 2) and Divmmc CONTROL_PORT at address $E3/227
With Divmmc paging active there are only 2 pages avalaible meanwhile all ram is avalaible with paging off.

                   MAPDISABLE=0          MAPDISABLE=1
  Sel. bits
      4            always 1             E3h   bit 5      (not present on 128K divmmcs)
      3            always 1             E3h   bit 4      (not present on 128K divmmcs)
      2            always 1             E3h   bit 3
      1            always 1             1ffdh bit 2
      0            7ffdh bit 4          7ffdh bit 4
  
With this addressing method we can load ZX Spectrum 48K, 128K and +2A/+3 roms into ram and make it work like real roms.
